# ES6 JavaScript Koans

WORK IN PROGRESS: ES6 JS Koans

Test base setup is based on David Laing's [JavaScript Koans](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans), which itself it based on Edgecase's [Ruby Koans](https://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans)

A good ES6 reference is [Understanding ES6](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read/) by [Nicholas C. Zakas](https://www.nczonline.net/). This is something I used whilst creating these Koans and a few of examples used are derived from the examples in his book.

## TODO

* Setup up base test runner

* Koan files
  * `AboutVariableTypes.js` - (`let`, `const`)
  * ~~`AboutStrings.js` - (new functions, templating)~~
  * ~~`AboutFunctions.js` - (default params, arrow functions)~~
  * ~~`AboutObjects.js`~~ - (shorthand, computed name)
  * ~~`AboutArrays.js`~~ - (new functions)
  * `AboutPromises.js` - (resolve, reject, methods)
  * ~~`AboutDeconstructing.js` - (syntax, object, array, mixed, default values)~~
  * ~~`AboutClasses.js`~~ - (constructors, extends, super, static functions)
  * `AboutMaps.js` - (strong, weak)
  * `AboutSets.js` - (strong, weak)
  * `AboutGenerators.js` - (syntax, usage)
